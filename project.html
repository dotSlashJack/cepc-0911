    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
        The final project you will be creating is the most important part of the course. You will use many of the methods you've learned throughout the first four weeks of the course and apply them to your own data sets. As I will mention in some lectures, I anticipate that your research projects will fall into two major categories: quantitative research and qualitative research. For those of you who are performing numerical analysis, you'll likely be using some of the statistical techniques you learn in week three, or perhaps other techniques and tools you've learned elsewhere. For those who are more interested in a deep dive into a set of documents or more of a "why" question, you'll be conducing more qualitative research. The kind of research you typically conduct often depends on the field you work in, though it's helpful to understand a wide variety of research techniques and terms that you might encounter. Your final project can take many forms. The one that will fit most closely with this course content is a "traditional" scientific research paper that you might see in a peer-reviewed journal such as Nature, JAMA, or IEEE Access. These typically contain the introduction, methods, results, conclusion, abstract, and reference sections. You are by no means constrained to this format though. You should keep in mind who your target audience and location for publication are, but this also can include government agencies, schools, magazines, many scicomm mediums, and others.

        <strong>Overview of Requirements</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The important thing is that you work through the research process and apply tools you acquire throughout the course. You will be required to provide a final written document and a short presentation in the final week of the course. Here are the broad requirements that all projects must meet:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
            <li>A clearly stated, well defined research hypothesis or goal</li>
            <li>An introduction (introduction to your topic, why your project is important, and what background information you have)</li>
            <li>A methods "section" (description of how and why you performed your analysis)</li>
            <li>Results (this can be either a results section in a scientific paper, or more broadly some final product)</li>
            <li>Limitations of your study/project</li>
            <li>A brief literature review</li>
            <li>A properly formatted bibliography/citations section</li>
            <li>A title</li>
            <li>A proper header (depends on your final publication medium, but should at a minimum include your name</li>
            <li>A major written component (depends on your target audience/medium, but I expect everyone will have at least 5 double spaced pages of content)</li>
            <li> Matching the formatting requirements of your ideal publication medium and location</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        I will describe some of these elements in lecture materials and probably upload supplementary text to this page, but if there are any gaps of course feel free to ask questions.
    </p>

    <h5>Publication format/medium</h5>

    <p>
        Depending on your project and target audience, your final product's ideal format, audience, and publication location will look very different. As part of the project, you will be required to pick a theoretical publication format. If you're doing a traditional journal-article-style project, you should look up journals that publish content on your topic. If it's a government recommendation or proposal, look up the formatting guidelines for that. If you're looking for a more popular and public-facing medium, look up magazines, websites, blogs, etc. (you get the idea). You will need to match (as closely as possible) the formatting guidelines outlined by your ideal publication location, and to submit a link to or summary of the requirements that I can evaluate you with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested, you are encouraged to submit your work to the publication medium and location you choose! But if you don't want to or you want to make more edits in the future, you won't be required to submit for publication.
    </p>

    <a href="" id="present"></a>
    <h5>Presentation</h5>
    <p>
        You will be creating a short presentation (about 5-7 minutes) that will summarize your final project and highlight your most important findings. This serves two main purposes: 1) practicing your presentation and dissemination skills; and 2) showing off your awesome research to your peers! I will give you more details on this as it approaches. If possible, we will have small breakout groups on zoom where everyone can present to to other in their group, but if this isn't possible then I'll find an asynchronous method.
    </p>
    
    <a href="" id="grading"></a>
    <h5>Grading</h5>

    <p>
        The final project is worth 40% of your grade, and the presentation is worth another 10%. There will be some smaller assignments that will make up part of this grade (e.g., submitting your drafts) and you will be given multiple rounds of feedback by me and your peers. You can check the schedule page to see when drafts and other assignments are due. You will be graded on the process more than a precise or perfect final result. If it's clear you've put a good faith effort into the project and have used some of the research techniques you've learned in this course, and that you've considered and incorporated suggestions from me and your peers, you will do just fine. Don't panic if I grade your draft very harshlyâ€”that's what drafts are for! Besides, the cutoff for an A is an 85%.
    </p>

    <h5>Other Information</h5>

    <p>
        I'm sure I'm forgetting to add something to this page, so I may update this to include additional information, but hopefully you get an idea of what to expect at least for now.
