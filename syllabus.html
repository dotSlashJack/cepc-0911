        <h5>Course Objectives</h5>
        <p>The motto of The Brown University School of Public Health is <i>"Learn public health by doing public health."</i> This idea extends to this course; you should <i>learn research by doing research</i>. This will hopefully be accomplished by working on (creating) a unique, personal project and learning the basics of research and relevant research methods and tools along the way.</p>
        <p>
        You can expect to understand/attain the following (among others):
        <ul style='text-indent: 30px;'>
            <li>Forming a research question and fitting it to available data</li>
            <li>Conducting a systematic review of evidence</li>
            <li>Understanding, evaluating, and synthesizing published articles/data</li>
            <li>Evaluating the trustworthiness and usefulness of a source</li>
            <li>Tailoring research to different audiences/publication goals</li>
            <li>Basics of statistics, citation methods, hypothesis testing, bias, inference, and data visualization</li>
            <li>Creating a research question that builds on existing evidence</li>
            <li>Publishing your project and presenting your research (This does not mean you're required to submit your paper/project for pulbication)</li>
            <li>Collaborating with peers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you feel I am not helping you to meet these goals, or you have questions or concerns, I encourage you to talk to me!</p>
        <a href="" id='prereqs'></a>
        <h5>Course Prerequisites</h5>
        <p>
            Technology requirements (firm requirements): Access to a computer running Windows (7 or later) or macOS (preferably El Capitan or later), ability to install software on your computer, and internet access. Any software we need in this class will be free or made free to you for the duration of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recommended (not required, but potentially helpful): Experience writing paper 8+ pages long, exposure to basic statistics and/or statistical software, and basic experience using word and excel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the goal of this course is to make academic-level research methods more accessible, but it will be fast paced--after all you're completing a research project in just six weeks! But you will learn a lot and have a completed research project that you can share at the end.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='expectations'></a>
        <h5>Course Expectations</h5>
        <p>
            I don't have a lot of strict expectations for this course. Research is a unique and often unpredictable process. Therefore I simply ask that you work hard, help others, and maintain an open mindset. Your final grade will be a reflection of your overall learning and discovery process, not based on a precise, accurate, or perfect result.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='topics'></a>
        <h5>Course Topics</h5>
        <p>
            Numerous research-related topics will be covered in this class. This includes searching for and citing sources, conducting a systematic review, how to evaluate evidence, basics of data exploration, basic hypothesis testing and statistics, basics of R, fundamentals of data visualization, academic writing and style choices, and dissemination and presentation of results. You can find more specific details about each of these on the schedule page. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these fundamentals, time will be dedicated to learning methods and tools you need for your specific projects. We might also have guest speakers that will record videos discussing the "real world" of research. I encourage you to let me know if there's a topic you want covered!<br>
            Not every skill you might need for your individual project can be covered in just a few weeks of class, so you will also learn how to find information and learn tools on your own, a skill that's immensely useful in your future research careers.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='materials'></a>
        <h5>Required Course Materials</h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Technology:</strong> As noted in the "prerequisites" section, you are expected to have a personal laptop running Windows 7+ or MacOS, and you need to be able to download and install software on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Software:</strong> All software will be provided to you, though owning Word and Excel might be helpful. All of the software will be linked on the schedule on the relevant day and a complete list of the sofware we will use can be found <a href='https://cepc-0911.jackhester.com/software.html'>here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Readings:</strong> Freely accessible readings will be accessible via a link on the schedule page. If a reading can only be accessed through the library or is paid, it will be uploaded to Canvas, either under "Files" or "E-Reserves." There are no required textbooks, though I will provide excerpts and recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Videos:</strong> Any lectures to watch will be linked on the <a href="https://cepc-0911.jackhester.com/lectures.html">lectures</a> page. If a video contains paid material, it will be uploaded under "Files" on Canvas.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='grading'></a>
        <h5>Grading</h5>
        <p>
            <p><strong>All assignments will be listed and linked to on the <a href='https://cepc-0911.jackhester.com/schedule.html'>schedule page</a>. Quizzes will be administered through Canvas.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Participation and peer collaboration: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>Your participation grade will be based on your engagement with the material and interaction with other students (via feedback/peer reviews, etc.).  Normally, this would make up a larger portion of your grade because collaboration is an absolutely essential skill in any career, and teamwork is crucial to successful research; however, the transiton to asyncrhonous learning obviously makes particiption more difficult to grade fairly. In addition, I believe you will learn the most from sharing your knowledge with others, and you will each bring a unique perspective and skill set to the content that neither I nor anyone else cannot bring. Because this course has moved to an online, asyncrhonous format, it is worth only 10% and you will be primarily assessed via your engagement with the materials and your peer-review feedback.</p>
            <p><strong>Quizzes: 20%</strong></p>
            <p>Quizzes will be open note (you will create "one-pagers," a concept I will cover, that you can bring with you). Quizzes are there primarily to ensure you are keeping up to date with the material and for creating helpful reference notes that you can take with you and use in your future research. There should be no "surprise" questions, but there will be a variety of question/answer formats. You will also be provided with answer keys after the quizzes are complete. One-pagers will be submitted along with the quizzes (at least the first couple) so that I can ensure you're identifying the key concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Homework modules/assignments: 20%</strong></p>
            <p>Homework assignments will range from journal article readings to online modules. It if seems reasonable, some of this work will be done as group work. Please note that "small" assignments like installing programs prior to the indicated class module are expected to be complete unless you've previously indicated that you had an issue; this is to ensure you aren't having problems before assignments using that software are due.</p>
            <p><strong>Final project (written work): 40%</strong></p>
            <p>Your final project is your own unique, open-ended research project result. This is the backbone of the course, and the applied nature of this project, including any successes and setbacks, is valuable as you learn how to do real-world research. Regardless of the exact form your final project takes, you will be required to submit, at a minimum, a literature review; if you can, you are encouraged to do rapid review. More details will be provided early in the course, and significant class time will be dedicated to working on your project.</p>
            <p><strong>Project presentation and publication: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to creating your final project and writing up the results, you will publish it online (more details will be provided) and give a brief presentation at the end of the class. Disseminating and communicating your research are very important in the research world.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Grading Cutoffs</strong></p>
            <p>
                A: 85%<br>
                B: 75%<br>
                C: 60%<br>
                NC: <60%
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>All Summer@Brown pre-college classes are graded as complete or incomplete (S/NC). However, your grade will give you a general idea of how you'd fair in a college course, and how well you're mastering the material. Keep in mind also that you will each be getting performance reviews at the end of the course.</strong></p>
        </p>

        <a href="" id="end"></a>

        <h5>Course completion, post-class details</h5>
            <p>
                <strong>Course grade and completion:</strong><br />

                Your grade in Canvas once all assignments have been graded will be your final percentage. If you have earned a 60% or above, you will have passed the course. You will recieve an "S" in the course for successful completion, or an "NC" if you have not completed the course successfully. Assuming you've successfully completed the course, you should receive a course completion certificate from Brown within about a month of the course end date.<br /><br />

                You will also recieve a performance evaluation that includes comments from your professor and TA. These will be completed as soon as possible after your final assignment is turned in. A copy should be sent to you and your parents, and can be used for future college or job applications where applicable. Since you are not receiving a true grade in the course, these will also provide an opportunity for us to comment on your strenghts and areas you can improve in as you continue your academic and research careers.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Accessing course materials after completion:</strong><br />
                
                Shortly after you complete the course, you will lose access to your Brown email, google drive, and canvas access. I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE A BACKUP OF ANY IMPORTANT GOOGLE DOCS OR EMAILS BEFORE THE COURSE END DATE. This course website will remain available for the forseeable future. If this course happens to be taught again with the same number, I will make a copy of this page and put a link to this version somewhere on the new page. If you would like to have a copy for yourself just in case, you can download all of the code/documents used on this website <a href="https://github.com/dotSlashJack/cepc-0911">here</a>.<br /><br />

                With your permission, I will be storing a copy of your presentations and/or papers on this website under a date-specific permalink. If you do so, you can feel free to link to the url on resumes, portfolios, etc.
            </p>    
            <p>
                <strong>Contacting me:</strong><br /><br />
                If you would like to reach out to me (Jack Hester) after the course ends, you are certainly welcome to email me. My brown email address will still be active, though I likely won't have it after about a year from now. I will be providing an additional personal email address via Slack should you want to contact me after my Brown email address has expired. If you would like to reach out to David in the future, I encourage you to ask for his email address via Slack as well.

        <a href="" id='formatting'></a>
        <h5>Formatting and Citation Guidelines</h5>
            <p>Please note more specific formatting details may be provided for specific assignments. Any specific assignment details take precedence. If you have questions, feel free to ask.</p>
            <p ><strong>Font: </strong>Times New Roman, 12pt font.</p>
            <p ><strong>Spacing and Margins: </strong>Double spacing, 1 inch margins.</p>
            <p><strong>Header: </strong><br>Last Name, First Name<br>Professor Name<br>Course Number/Section<br>Date Assignment is Due</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Citations: </strong>You are expected to cite anything that is not your own work. In addition, if you state a fact that you is not "common knowledge," then you should cite it even if you didn't directly quote or paraphase the original source(s). When in doubt, it's better to cite than not. In addition, paraphrasing does not exclude you from needing to cite the source. It is imperative that you properly credit the source of the information you are summarizing with the correct in-text and bibliography citations.</p>
            <p><strong>Citation Styles: </strong>There are many citation styles that are used for different reasons. Typically you will want to use MLA or Chicago, but consider the type of research you're conducting and if there is a typical citation style for that kind of research, (such as MLA, APA, Chicago, AMA, etc.), then you are encouraged to use that citation style. In general, you are expected to include in-text citations and a corresponding full bibliographic entry.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning: </strong>Failing to properly cite sources is a serious offense at Brown and, more importantly, will severely damage your reputation in the research community. Plagarism and/or lack of citations can result in a failing grade or even expulsion. Please reference the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/student-conduct/code">student conduct handbook</a> for more information. </p>

        <h5>Students with Special Needs</h5>
        <p>
            Official Statement: "Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students. Students who, by nature of a documented disability, require academic accommodations should contact the professor during office hours. Students may also speak with Student and Employee Accessibility Services at 401-863-9588 to discuss the process for requesting accommodations."<br>
            I have first-hand experience with navigating academia while managing a "disability." My goal is to improve your learning as best as is possible, so please feel free to let me know if I can help you to feel more welcome or improve accessibility, even if you don't have an official letter from SEAS.

        <a href="" id='integrity'></a>
        <h5>Academic Integrity and Conduct</h5>
        <p>
            Integrity, honesty, and attribution are extremely important in research. I expect that your work will be your own, that you will cite your sources properly, and that you will be respectful of others and their work. Academic dishonesty can result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to failing the course. While you have to comply with Brown University policies, I sincerly hope that you will take academic honesty and integrity seriously because it is critical to becoming a good researcher.
