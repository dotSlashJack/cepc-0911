        <h5>Course Objectives</h5>
        <p>The motto of The Brown University School of Public Health is <i>"Learn public health by doing public health."</i> This idea extends to this course; you should <i>learn research by doing research</i>. This will hopefully be accomplished by working on (doing) a unique, personal project and learning the basics of research and relevant research methods and tools along the way.</p>
        <p>
        You can expect to understand/attain the following (among others):
        <ul style='text-indent: 30px;'>
            <li>Forming a research question and fitting it to available data</li>
            <li>Conducting a systematic review of evidence</li>
            <li>Understanding, evaluating, and synthesizing published articles/data</li>
            <li>Evaluating the trustworthiness and usefulness of a source</li>
            <li>Tailoring research to different audiences/publication goals</li>
            <li>Basics of statistics, citation methods, hypothesis testing, bias, inference, and data visualization</li>
            <li>Creating a research question that builds on existing evidence</li>
            <li>Publishing your project and presenting your research</li>
            <li>Collaborating with peers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you feel I am not helping you to meet these goals, or you have questions or concerns, I encourage you to talk to me!</p>
        <a href="" id='prereqs'></a>
        <h5>Course Prerequisites</h5>
        <p>
            Technology requirements (firm requirements): Access to a computer running Windows (7 or later) or macOS (preferably El Capitan or later) both during and outside of class, ability to install software on your computer, and internet access outside of class time. Any software we need in this class will be free or made free to you for the duration of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recommended (not required, but potentially helpful): Experience writing paper 8+ pages long, exposure to basic statistics and/or statistical software, and basic experience using word and excel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the goal of this course is to make academic-level research methods more accessible, but because this course is condensed into 4 weeks, there will be some components that will likely require substantial work outside of class. It will be fast paced—after all you’re completing a research project in just four weeks! But you will learn a lot and have a completed research project that you can share at the end.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='expectations'></a>
        <h5>Course Expectations</h5>
        <p>
            I don't have a lot of strict expectations for this course. Research is a unique and often unpredictable process. Therefore I simply ask that you work hard, help others, and maintain an open mindset. Your final grade will be a reflection of your overall learning and discovery process, not based on a precise, accurate, or perfect result.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='topics'></a>
        <h5>Course Topics</h5>
        <p>
            Numerous research-related topics will be covered in this class. This includes searching for and citing sources, conducting a systematic review, how to evaluate evidence, basics of data exploration, basic hypothesis testing and statistics, basics of R and Python, fundamentals of data visualization, academic writing and style choices, and dissemination and presentation of results. You can find more specific details about each of these on the schedule page. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these fundamentals, time will be dedicated to learning methods and tools you need for your specific projects. We will also have guest speakers come in to discuss the "real world" of research. I encourage you to let me know if there's a topic you want covered!<br>
            Not every skill you might need for your individual project can be covered in just a few weeks of class, so you will also learn how to find information and learn tools on your own, a skill that's immensely useful in your future research careers.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='materials'></a>
        <h5>Required Course Materials</h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Technology:</strong> As noted in the "prerequisites" section, you are expected to have a personal laptop running Windows 7+ or MacOS, and you need to be able to download and install software on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Software:</strong> All software will be provided to you, though owning Word and Excel might be helpful. All of the software will be linked on the schedule on the relevant day and a complete list of the sofware we will use can be found <a href='https://cepc-0911.jackhester.com/software.html'>here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Readings:</strong> Freely accessible readings will be accessible via a link on the schedule page. If a reading can only be accessed through the library or is paid, it will be uploaded to Canvas, either under "Files" or "E-Reserves." There are no required textbooks, though I will provide excerpts and recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Videos:</strong> Any videos to watch will be linked on the videos page. If a video is paid material, it will be uploaded under "Files" on Canvas.
        </p>
        <a href="" id='grading'></a>
        <h5>Grading</h5>
        <p>
            <p><strong>All assignments will be listed and linked to on the <a href='https://cepc-0911.jackhester.com/schedule.html'>schedule page</a>. Quizzes will be administered through Canvas.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Participation and peer collaboration: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>Your participation grade will be based on your engagement with the material and interaction with other students (via feedback/peer reviews, etc.).  Normally, this would make up a larger portion of your grade because collaboration is an absolutely essential skill in any career, and teamwork is crucial to successful research. In addition, I believe you will learn the most from sharing your knowledge with others, and you will each bring a unique perspective and skill set to the content that neither I nor anyone else cannot bring. Because this course has moved to an online, asyncrhonous format, it is worth only 10% and you will be primarily assessed via your engagement with the materials and your peer-review feedback.</p>
            <p><strong>Quizzes: 20%</strong></p>
            <p>Quizzes will be open note (you will create "one-pagers," a concept I will cover in class, that you can bring with you). Quizzes are there primarily to ensure you are keeping up to date with the material and for creating helpful reference notes that you can take with you and use in your future research. There should be no "surprise" questions, but there will be a variety of question/answer formats. You will also be provided with answer keys after the quizzes are complete. One-pagers will be submitted along with the quizzes (at least the first couple) so that I can ensure you're identifying the key concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Homework modules/assignments: 20%</strong></p>
            <p>Homework assignments will range from journal article readings to online modules. It if seems reasonable, some of this work will be done as group work. Please note that "small" assignments like installing programs prior to coming to the indicated class module, and are expected to be complete unless you've previously indicated that you had an issue; this is to ensure you aren't having problems before assignments using that software are due.</p>
            <p><strong>Final project (written work): 40%</strong></p>
            <p>Your final project is your own unique, open-ended research project result. This is the backbone of the course, and the applied nature of this project, including any successes and setbacks, is valuable as you learn how to do real-world research. More details will be provided early in the course, and significant class time will be dedicated to working on your project.</p>
            <p><strong>Project presentation and publication: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to creating your final project and writing up the results, you will publish it online (more details will be provided) and give a brief presentation at the end of the class. Disseminating and communicating your research are very important in the research world.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Grading Cutoffs</strong></p>
            <p>
                A: 85%<br>
                B: 75%<br>
                C: 60%<br>
                NC: <60%
            </p>
            
            <p>You might be suprised that an 85% is an A. I will be grading your assignments very thoroughly (and therefore what you might consider "harshly"), but this will not preclude you from doing well in the class. Keep in mind that 40% of your grade (really 50% if you consider the presentaiton) is dedicated to the final project. You will have submitted a partial and full draft to me for review, so I anticipate you'll do well on the final draft! If at the end grades are lower than I would expect, I will adjust accordingly. Please also note that I won't "curve" any grades down; if everyone gets an A I'll be very happy!</p>
        </p>
        <a href="" id='formatting'></a>
        <h5>Formatting and Citation Guidelines</h5>
            <p>Please note more specific formatting details may be provided for specific assignments. Any specific assignment details take precedence. If you have questions, feel free to ask.</p>
            <p ><strong>Font: </strong>Times New Roman, 12pt font.</p>
            <p ><strong>Spacing and Margins: </strong>Double spacing, 1 inch margins.</p>
            <p><strong>Header: </strong><br>Last Name, First Name<br>Professor Name<br>Course Number/Section<br>Date Assignment is Due</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Citations: </strong>You are expected to cite anything that is not your own work. In addition, if you state a fact that you is not "common knowledge," then you should cite it even if you didn't directly quote or paraphase the original source(s). When in doubt, it's better to cite than not. In addition, paraphrasing does not exclude you from needing to cite the source. It is imperative that you properly credit the source of the information you are summarizing with the correct in-text and bibliography citations.</p>
            <p><strong>Citation Styles: </strong>There are many citation styles that are used for different reasons. Typically you will want to use MLA or Chicago, but consider the type of research you're conducting and if there is a typical citation style for that kind of research, (such as MLA, APA, Chicago, AMA, etc.), then you are encouraged to use that citation style. In general, you are expected to include in-text citations and a corresponding full bibliographic entry.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning: </strong>Failing to properly cite sources is a serious offense at Brown and, more importantly, will severely damage your reputation in the research community. Plagarism and/or lack of citations can result in a failing grade or even expulsion. Please reference the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/student-conduct/code">student conduct handbook</a> for more information. </p>
