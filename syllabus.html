        <p>If you feel I am not helping you to meet these goals, or you have questions or concerns, I encourage you to talk to me!</p>
        <a href="" id='prereqs'></a>
        <h4>Course Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>
            Technology requirements (firm requirements): Access to a computer running Windows (7 or later) or macOS (preferably El Capitan or later) both during and outside of class, ability to install software on your computer, and internet access outside of class time. Any software we need in this class will be free or made free to you for the duration of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recommended (not required, but potentially helpful): Experience writing paper 8+ pages long, exposure to basic statistics and/or statistical software, and basic experience using word and excel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the goal of this course is to make academic-level research methods more accessible, but because this course is condensed into 4 weeks, there will be some components that will likely require substantial work outside of class. It will be fast paced—after all you’re completing a research project in just four weeks! But you will learn a lot and have a completed research project that you can share at the end.

        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>
            <p><strong>All assignments will be listed and linked to on the <a href='https://php-xxx.jackhester.com/schedule.html'>schedule page</a>. Quizzes may be adminstered through Canvas.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Participation and peer collaboration: 25%</strong></p>
            <p>Your participation grade will be based on your engagement with the material and interaction with other students in class and outside class (where applicable). This primarily includes commenting and asking questions during lectures, participating in group work, and providing peer feedback, suggestions, comments, and recommendations throughout the project creation process. This category makes up such a large portion of your grade for a couple of reasons. First, collaboration is an absolutely essential skill in any carreer, and team work is crucial to successful research. Second, I believe you will learn the most from sharing your knowledge with others, and you will each bring a unique perspective and skill set to the content that neither I nor anyone else cannot bring.</p>
            <p><strong>Quizzes: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>Quizzes will be open note (you will create "one-pagers," a concept I will cover in class, that you can bring with you). Quizzes are there primarily to ensure you are keeping up to date with the material and creating helpful reference notes that you can take with you and use in your future research. There should be no surprise questions, but there will be a variety of question/answer formats. You will also be provided with answer keys after the quizzes are complete.</p>
            <p><strong>Homework modules/assignments: 15%</strong></p>
            <p>Homework assignments will range from journal article readings to online modules. You will be graded on completing the assignments, and you will not lose points for incorrect answers unless it is clear you did not put significant effort into completing the assignments. Some of this work will be done as group work in class. Please note that "small" assignments like installing programs prior to coming to class will be graded, and are expected to be complete unless you've previously indicated that you had an issue; this is to ensure everyone can make the most of their in-class time.</p>
            <p><strong>Final project (written work): 40%</strong></p>
            <p>Your final project is your own unique, open-ended research project result. This is the backbone of the course, and the applied nature of this project, including any successes and setbacks, is valuable as you learn how to do real-world research. More details will be provided early in the course, and significant class time will be dedicated to working on your project.</p>
            <p><strong>Project presentation and publication: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to creating your final project and writing up the results, you will publish it online (more details will be provided) and give a brief presentation at the end of the class. Disseminating and communicating your research are very important in the research world.</p>
            <p><strong>A note on attendance from the Brown University website:</strong><br><br>
                "It is in the interest of every student to attend all sessions of the classes in which registered, and each student has an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all by full participation in the work of each class; however, within such limits as are necessary for the general welfare, a student benefits also from exercising discretion and assuming responsibility for his or her educational progress.
                <br>
                Accordingly, unless the instructor imposes attendance requirements, students are not limited with respect to the number of absences from a course. When, in the instructor’s opinion, a student is abusing the privilege of voluntary attendance, the appropriate dean’s office should be notified so that appropriate action may be taken.
                <br>
                A student is always fully responsible for any course work missed because of absences and will be assigned failing grades in final examinations missed without excuse from the dean’s office."
                <br>
                With this in mind, it is very important that you attend the classes so you can collaborate and learn through hands-on research facilitated by in-class activities. Please let me know of any extenuating circumstances.

            To facilitate ongoing discussion outside of class time, I have created a Slack channel. You can post questions about class content or your project, share sources, or discuss anything else class-related. I will also monitor Slack as much as possible and answer questions.

            I have first-hand experience with navigating academia while managing a "disability." My goal is to improve your learning as best as is possible, so please feel free to let me know if I can help you to feel more welcome or improve accessibility, even if you don't have an official letter from SEAS.
