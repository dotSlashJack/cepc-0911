        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>
            <p><strong>Participation and peer collaboration: 25%</strong></p>
            <p>Your participation grade will be based on your engagement with the material and interaction with other students in class and outside class (where applicable). This primarily includes commenting and asking questions during lectures, participating in group work, and providing peer feedback, suggestions, comments, and recommendations throughout the project creation process. This category makes up such a large portion of your grade for a couple of reasons. First, collaboration is an absolutely essential skill in any carreer, and team work is crucial to successful research. Second, I believe you will learn the most from sharing your knowledge with others, and you will each bring a unique perspective and skill set to the content that neither I nor anyone else cannot bring.</p>
            <p><strong>Quizzes: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>Quizzes will be open note (you will create "one-pagers," a concept I will cover in class, that you can bring with you). Quizzes are there primarily to ensure you are keeping up to date with the material and creating helpful reference notes that you can take with you and use in your future research. There should be no surprise questions, but there will be a variety of question/answer formats. You will also be provided with answer keys after the quizzes are complete.</p>
            <p><strong>Homework modules/assignments: 15%</strong></p>
            <p>Homework assignments will range from journal article readings to online modules. You will be graded on completing the assignments, and you will not lose points for incorrect answers unless it is clear you did not put significant effort into completing the assignments. Some of this work will be done as group work in class. Please note that "small" assignments like installing programs prior to coming to class will be graded, and are expected to be complete unless you've previously indicated that you had an issue; this is to ensure everyone can make the most of their in-class time.</p>
            <p><strong>Final project (written work): 40%</strong></p>
            <p>Your final project is your own unique, open-ended research project result. This is the backbone of the course, and the applied nature of this project, including any successes and setbacks, is valuable as you learn how to do real-world research. More details will be provided early in the course, and significant class time will be dedicated to working on your project.</p>
            <p><strong>Project presentation and publication: 10%</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to creating your final project and writing up the results, you will publish it online (more details will be provided) and give a brief presentation at the end of the class. Disseminating and communicating your research are very important in the research world.</p>
            <p><strong>A note on attendance:</strong> Brown University requires you attend _____% of classes to complete the course. Attendance is also important as you will be workshopping projects and completing group assignments. If there are extenuating circumstances, we will work something out.</p>

            To facilitate ongoing discussion outside of class time, I have created a Slack channel. You can post questions about class content or your project, share sources, or discuss anything else class-related. I will also monitor Slack as much as possible and answer questions.
