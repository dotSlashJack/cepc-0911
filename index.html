            <h4>Welcome to CEPC-0904: "From idea to publication: building your own research project!"</h4>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>TBA</p>
            <p>You can navigate to the course calendar, syllabus, and assignment details using the links in the navigation bar above. Canvas will be used to submit assignments, take quizzes, and receive grades. I will also maintain a copy of the syllabus on Canvas. If any changes to the schedule are made, they will be refelected on this website. In the case that any substantial chage to the syllabus needs to be made (which I do not anticipate), I will notify you as soon as possible.</p>
