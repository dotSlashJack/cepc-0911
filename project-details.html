    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
        The final project you will be creating is the most important part of the course. You will use many of the methods you've learned throughout the first four weeks of the course and apply them to your own data sets. As I will mention in some lectures, I anticipate that your research projects will fall into two major categories: quantitative research and qualitative research. For those of you who are performing numerical analysis, you'll likely be using some of the statistical techniques you learn in week three, or perhaps other techniques and tools you've learned elsewhere. For those who are more interested in a deep dive into a set of documents or more of a "why" question, you'll be conducing more qualitative research. The kind of research you typically conduct often depends on the field you work in, though it's helpful to understand a wide variety of research techniques and terms that you might encounter. Your final project can take many forms. The one that will fit most closely with this course content is a "traditional" scientific research paper that you might see in a peer-reviewed journal such as Nature, JAMA, or IEEE Access. These typically contain the introduction, methods, results, conclusion, abstract, and reference sections. You are by no means constrained to this format though. You should keep in mind who your target audience and location for publication are, but this also can include government agencies, schools, magazines, many scicomm mediums, and others. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Overview of Requirements</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The important thing is that you work through the research process and apply tools you acquire throughout the course. You will be required to provide a final written document and a short presentation in the final week of the course. Here are the broad requirements that all projects must meet:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
            <li>A clearly stated, well defined research hypothesis or goal</li>
            <li>An introduction (introduction to your topic, why your project is important, and what background information you have)</li>
            <li>A methods "section" (description of how and why you performed your analysis)</li>
            <li>Results (this can be either a results section in a scientific paper, or more broadly some final product)</li>
            <li>Limitations of your study/project</li>
            <li>A brief literature review</li>
            <li>A properly formatted bibliography/citations section</li>
            <li>A title</li>
            <li>A proper header (depends on your final publication medium, but should at a minimum include your name</li>
            <li>A major written component (depends on your target audience/medium, but I expect everyone will have at least 5 double spaced pages of content)</li>
            <li> Matching the formatting requirements of your ideal publication medium and location</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        I will describe some of these elements in lecture materials and probably upload supplementary text to this page, but if there are any gaps of course feel free to ask questions.
    </p>
    <a href="" id="pub"></a>
        
    <h5>Publication format/medium</h5>

    <p>
        Depending on your project and target audience, your final product's ideal format, audience, and publication location will look very different. As part of the project, you will be required to pick a theoretical publication format. If you're doing a traditional journal-article-style project, you should look up journals that publish content on your topic. If it's a government recommendation or proposal, look up the formatting guidelines for that. If you're looking for a more popular and public-facing medium, look up magazines, websites, blogs, etc. (you get the idea). You will need to match (as closely as possible) the formatting guidelines outlined by your ideal publication location, and to submit a link to or summary of the requirements that I can evaluate you with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested, you are encouraged to submit your work to the publication medium and location you choose! But if you don't want to or you want to make more edits in the future, you won't be required to submit for publication.
    </p>

    <a href="" id="present"></a>
    <h5>Presentation</h5>
    <p>
        You will be creating a short presentation (about 5 minutes) that will summarize your final project and highlight your most important findings. This serves two main purposes: 1) practicing your presentation and dissemination skills; and 2) showing off your awesome research to your peers! I will give you more details on this as it approaches. If possible, we will have small breakout groups on zoom where everyone can present to to other in their group, but if this isn't possible then I'll find an asynchronous method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your presentation should contain the following elements:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>A title</li>
            <li>An introduction to your project, including why it's important and why you chose your topic</li>
            <li>A brief overview of your methodlogy and description of which analysis and/or data collection methods you used</li>
            <li>A summary of key results (even if they aren't significant!)</li>
            <li>Conclusions you could draw and/or lessons you learned</li>
            <li>Limiations, futuer directions, and where you would publish this (if you decided you wanted to)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        You can create a short powerpoint slide deck or use another method to present if you prefer. I recommend you practice a couple of times before presenting. Students will have the option to ask one or two questions (assuming we do this synchronously).
    </p>
    
    <a href="" id="grading"></a>
    <h5>Grading</h5>

    <p>
        The final project is worth 40% of your grade, and the presentation is worth another 10%. There will be some smaller assignments that will make up part of this grade (e.g., submitting your drafts) and you will be given multiple rounds of feedback by me and your peers. You can check the schedule page to see when drafts and other assignments are due. You will be graded on the process more than a precise or perfect final result. If it's clear you've put a good faith effort into the project and have used some of the research techniques you've learned in this course, and that you've considered and incorporated suggestions from me and your peers, you will do just fine. Don't panic if I grade your draft very harshlyâ€”that's what drafts are for! Besides, the cutoff for an A is an 85%.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be graded on the following:<br />

        <ul>
            <li>You have included all of the sections listed above</li>
            <li>You follow your theoretical publication's guidelines (where applicable)</li>
            <li>There are few gramatical mistakes and virtually free of spelling errors</li>
            <li>It is at least five pages along, not including citations, but it is also long enough to contain everything you need to explain your methods, summarize key literature, etc.</li>
            <li>You've included your name and a proper header (matches publication sytle or one on course website)</li>
            <li>You include a properly formatted references section and in-text citations</li>
            <li>It is submitted via CANVAS not via email, etc.</li>
            <li>It is turned in on time (by Aug. 12, 2020 at midnight EDT, will not accept it after Aug 13 at 11:59 EDT as I need to turn in your grades)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <a href="" id="peer"></a>
    <h5>Peer Review</h5>

    <p>
        You will be providing peer feedback to a few other students in the course, and also receiving feeback from them. By doing so, you will gain additional perspectives from other class members and practice reviewing other peoples' work, which is a useful and often necessary tool in academic or other research. You will be placed into groups of approximately 4-5 people, and you will be sharing your drafts with them over the final weekend of the course. David will add you to breakout groups in Slack based on topic and/or methodology. You can share your papers there or via email. You should provide feedback to all of your other group members by the end of Monday, August 12. This will count as part of your participation grade. 
    </p>

    <h5>Other Information</h5>

    <p>
        I'm sure I'm forgetting to add something to this page, so I may update this to include additional information, but hopefully you get an idea of what to expect at least for now.
